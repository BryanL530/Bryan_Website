      <h2>Day 1 (6/8/22)</h2>
      <p>
        This is the first day of the learning practice, 
        I learned some basics of the html and css. 
        Overall, the stuff I see isn't too complicated or anything, 
        but it will definately take some practice to remember all the tag 
        in the blink of the thought. <br>

      <h3>Problems & Thoughts</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The navigation bar and background is repeated in all the pages; 
          I want to find a way to make them into one
        </li>
        <li>
          Writing dev log in webpage isn't ideal, 
          preferably to write it in a txt file.
        </li>
        <li>
          It seems like the previous problems might be solved with <strong>Javascript</strong>, 
          will take a look into it tomorrow.
        </li>
