        <h2>Log 1 (6/8/22)</h2>
        <p>
          This is the first day of the learning practice, I learned some basics
          of the html and css. Overall, the stuff I see isn't too complicated or
          anything, but it will definately take some practice to remember all
          the tag in the blink of the thought. <br />

        <h3>Problems & Thoughts</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The navigation bar and background is repeated in all the pages; I
            want to find a way to make them into one
          </li>
          <li>
            Writing dev log in webpage isn't ideal, preferably to write it in a
            txt file.
          </li>
          <li>
            It seems like the previous problems might be solved with
            <strong>Javascript</strong>, will take a look into it tomorrow.
          </li>

        <h2>Log 2 (6/17/22)</h2>
        <p>
          This is finally the second day I can devote more hours to consider
          working a full day. Over the past few days or even the last week, I
          finally figure out how to make the nav bar stick to the top. Sticky is
          the way to do it, it is better than fixed from what I see, hopefully
          it is now supported on most if not all browsers. My plan for the next
          few days is to grind through all the
          <a

          >
            MDN guides
          </a>
          I see for html and css as I think I am about to handle those within 2
          or 3 days. Am wishing that I can get through those fast and to the
          Javascript to have a better way of writing this logs.

        <h2>Log 3 (6/19/22)</h2>
        <p>
          This MDN guide is definately longer than I expected, I am just
          finished with the HTML guide. It is mostly reading on something I
          know, but I did learn something new for the whole guide for HTML
          section. <br /><br />

          I really like the <code>&lt;sup&gt;</code> and
          <code>&lt;sub&gt;</code>. It seems nice to format the text.
        </p>
        <h3>Problems & Thoughts</h3>
        <p>
          I messed with a bit Javascript today when learning some of the HTML,
          It seems do be the way to sqeeze every daily-log into a more defined
          space. On the side notes, the string format is really weird to me,
          where "2+2" will pass in as 4. as 4.

        <h2>Log 4 (7/12/22)</h2>
        <p>
          It has been a while since I last wrote a log. As I ran out of idea on
          how I should design the project page. Different from last month, more
          and more concepts I learn on MDN guides are able to be applied
          instantly, such as responsive media. Although I didn't have much
          updated on the home page since the last update, I did manage to do a
          bit of animation. Animation reminds me how much we as human rely on
          changes to identify changes.
        </p>
        <h3>Problems & Thoughts</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Animations gives us queues on changes</li>
          <li>Classes vs Selector combinations (except specificity)</li>
          <li>How API are used in JS (haven't learn JS just yet)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Plans</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Finish CSS lesson before late July</li>
          <li>Design the project page and polish this page</li>
          <li>Learn JS and do some Leetcode on it</li>
          <li>Play with other API</li>
        </ul>
