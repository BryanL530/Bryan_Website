        <h2>Day 1 (6/8/22)</h2>
        <p>
          This is the first day of the learning practice,
          I learned some basics of the html and css.
          Overall, the stuff I see isn't too complicated or anything,
          but it will definately take some practice to remember all the tag
          in the blink of the thought. <br>
        </p>
        <h3>Problems & Thoughts</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The navigation bar and background is repeated in all the pages;
            I want to find a way to make them into one
          </li>
          <li>
            Writing dev log in webpage isn't ideal,
            preferably to write it in a txt file.
          </li>
          <li>
            It seems like the previous problems might be solved with <strong>Javascript</strong>,
            will take a look into it tomorrow.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Day 2 (6/17/22)</h2>
        <p>
          This is finally the second day I can devote more hours to consider
          working a full day. Over the past few days or even the last week,
          I finally figure out how to make the nav bar stick to the top. Sticky
          is the way to do it, it is better than fixed from what I see,
          hopefully it is now supported on most if not all browsers.
          My plan for the next few days is to grind through all the
          <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn" target="_blank">
            MDN guides
          </a>
          I see for html and css as I think I am about to handle those within 2
          or 3 days. Am wishing that I can get through those fast and to the
          Javascript to have a better way of writing this logs.
        </p>
        <h3>Problems & Thoguhts</h3>
        <p>Same as above</p>

        <h2>Day 3 (6/19/22)</h2>
        <p>
          This MDN guide is definately longer than I expected, I am just 
          finished with the HTML guide. It is mostly reading on something 
          I know, but I did learn something new for the whole guide 
          for HTML section. <br><br>

          I really like the <code>&lt;sup&gt;</code> and 
          <code>&lt;sub&gt;</code>. It seems nice to format the text.
        </p>
        <h3>Problems & Thoughts</h3>
        <p>
          I messed with a bit Javascript today when learning some of the HTML, 
          It seems do be the way to sqeeze every daily-log into a more defined 
          space. On the side notes, the string format is really weird to me, 
          where "2+2" will pass in as 4.
          as 4.
